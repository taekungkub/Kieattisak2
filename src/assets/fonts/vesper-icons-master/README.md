# Vesper Icons

Icon font for the web, compatible with [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) version 4.x, made by by [KK Vesper](http://kkvesper.jp/)


### WARNING

Vesper Icons is in a public preview state. Icons may be tweaked or removed without warning,
so please be very careful when upgrading even from tiny versions.


### Usage

Usage is equivalent to [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/), except with `"vs"` CSS class as the base:

```

You can mix Vesper Icons with Font Awesome modifier classes, e.g.:

```
<i class="vs vs-butterfly fa-3x fa-spin" />
```

### More Info

Vesper Icons are an original creation. However, [some icons may resemble designs found elsewhere
on the internets](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ThereIsOnlyOneCloudIconInTheEntireUniverse.aspx),
including variations of icons in [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/). If we've done something daft please raise an issue
and we'll discuss in a civil manner.

**To Font Awesome:** If you'd like to take icons from our set and add them to FontAwesome,
we're all for it, please get in touch.


### Workflow

I'm glad to accept PRs to automate the below overly-manual steps.

#### Design

Workflow depends on Type 3 font editor for Windows, which is a paid software program. If anyone knows a good FOSS cross-platform font editor let me know.

- Draw vectors in favorite tool (Adobe Illustrator, Corel DRAW, etc.)
- Export to SVG
- In Type 3 font editor:
   - Open .gfs file in Type 3
   - View -> Grid -> Grid Size...: Set to 64 units
   - Add Glyph(s), import SVG, edit
   - Adjust right-hand kerning margin to fit design
   - Map Glyph(s) to next available Unicode hex

#### Release

- Prepare Type 3 file:
   - Font -> Names... -> Advanced: Bump "Version"
   - Font -> Description... -> Advanced: Bump "Version"
   - Export to OTF, add to Git
- Generate Webfonts via `build.bat`
   - Uses [marmot](https://github.com/petethepig/marmot) to go [FontSquirrel Webfont Generator](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator)
   - Uses "Basic" and export
   - Renames exported files `vesper-icons.xxx` --> `vesper-icons-webfont.xxx`
- Add new glyph codes to CSS
- Update CHANGELOG
- Bump version in CSS, package.json, and component.json (use find/replace)
- Create release tag (in format "5.1.0") in Github
